# ESP32-Based Wi-Fi Controlled RC Car ðŸš—ðŸ“¡

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and fabrication of a Wi-Fi controlled RC car using an ESP32 microcontroller. The chassis was custom-designed in SolidWorks and optimized for 3D printing.

**Skills Used:** SolidWorks, 3D Printing, Embedded Systems, Arduino IDE  
**Tools:** SolidWorks, ESP32, FDM 3D Printer, Fusion 360 (optional)
